# Camelont-API-readme-and-code
PURPOSE
API is to gather data about customers, their behavior, and their purchases, and to provide businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior and purchase history. It will also provide a platform for customers to buy digital coins and manage their digital wallets and cards.
<->
This is just a basic example of how you could build an API using the Flask framework in Python to gather customer data and provide businesses with insights, as well as a platform for customers to buy digital coins and manage their digital wallets. You may need to add more functionality and error handling depending on your specific requirements.
Also, this is not a complete code, it is just an example of how you could structure the endpoints of your API.
To connect it to blockchain you could use a package like web3.py or use an existing blockchain platform like Ethereum.

    # Add purchased digital coins to customer's digital wallet

    return jsonify({'message': 'Purchase successful'}), 200
